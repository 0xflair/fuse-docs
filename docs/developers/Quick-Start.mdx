## Get Started with Fuse

This guide will provide you with an overview of the Fuse ecosystem. It will also include links to helpful resources and websites that will help you learn more about building blockchain applications, not only on Fuse but also on other platforms.

## Building on Fuse

If you are an Ethereum developer, you are already a Fuse developer. Simply switch to the [Fuse RPC](https://docs.fuse.io/docs/basics/getting-started-with-fuse/network-details) and get started. All the tools you are familiar with on the Ethereum blockchain are supported on Fuse by default, such as Truffle, Remix, and Web3js.

You can deploy decentralized applications to either Fuse Spark Testnet or the Mainnet.

## Publicly available Fuse RPC endpoints

Check out a [list of public endpoints](https://docs.fuse.io/docs/basics/getting-started-with-fuse/rpc#fuse-labs) for the Fuse Network.
