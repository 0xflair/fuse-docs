**Step 3:**

Select the Validator node where you want to delegate your tokens by considering various factors like fees, uptime etc.

You should see the “**stake**” option when you hover over the Validator you want to delegate your tokens to and click on stake. You should see the name of the validator you selected on the right hand side. Enter the amount you want to stake and click on “**Stake**”. Approve the transaction on Metamask and wait for the confirmation on-chain.

You will also see the APY on staking when you enter the amount of FUSE you want to stake. You can see the staked amount right next to the validator name to whom you have delegated you stake to.

**How to Unstake FUSE:**

Click on the Validator name and you should see the validator name with address on the right hand side. Click on “**unstake**” and enter the amount you want to unstake and click on “**unstake**”. Confirm the transaction on Metamask and wait for the on-chain confirmation. Once the transaction is confirmed the unstaked amount is transferred back to your address.
