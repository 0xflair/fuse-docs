This tutorial was made using Ledger Nano S with firmware version 1.6.1 and Ethereum app version on Ledger Nano S was 1.3.7.

Step 1: Please make sure that you have installed the latest version of Ethereum app on your Ledger as shown below.

Step 4: Once you click “Next” in the previous step now you will have to change the Network to “Fuse network” and then select the Wallet address you would like to Send/Receive FUSE tokens, accept the terms and conditions and click on “Access my Wallet”.

Step 5: Now that you have logged in to your address in Ledger through MyEtherWallet on Fuse network, you can see your Fuse address (Fusenet), balance, etc.

Now let’s learn how to stake FUSE.

Step 6: Click on “Contract” and then click on Interact with contract and

1. Enter the consensus contract address 0x3014ca10b91cb3D0AD85fEf7A3Cb95BCAc9c0f79
2. Copy the consensus ABI from below link

[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fuseio/fuse-network/master/abis/Consensus\_abi.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fuseio/fuse-network/master/abis/Consensus_abi.json)

Click on “Continue”.

Step 7:

From the drop down select the “Delegate” function and then copy the “Validator address” from the staking UI. Enter the amount of FUSE you want to stake under “Value in ETH” and click on “Write”. In the below example I have copied ”Liquify” validators address to stake.

Review and confirm the transaction on your Ledger. Once the transaction is confirmed on-chain it means you have staked your FUSE successfully.

Now let's learn to withdraw the staked FUSE.

Step 8: Follow Step 1 to Step 6 from above.

From the drop down select the “Withdraw” function and then copy the “Validator address” from the staking UI to which you have delegated your stake. Enter the amount of FUSE you want to stake under “\_amount(uint256)”, “value in ETH” should be 0 and click on “Write”.

Review and confirm the transaction on your Ledger. Once the transaction is confirmed on-chain it means you have unstaked your FUSE successfully.
