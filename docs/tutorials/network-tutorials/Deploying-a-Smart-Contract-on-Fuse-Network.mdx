title: Deploying a Smart Contract on Fuse Network
---

Fuse Network is an EVM compatible blockchain, every tool for Ethereum can be used for the Fuse network too.

Remix is a powerful, open source tool that helps you write Solidity contracts straight from the browser. Written in JavaScript, Remix supports both usage in the browser and locally.

Remix also supports testing, debugging and deploying of smart contracts and much more. 

Pre-requisites:

Since we interact with remix using Metamask, you need to change the network to Fuse network by adding a custom RPC. 

You need to have a small balance of FUSE on the Fusenet wallet you are using which will be used as Gas for the transactions. 

Step 1:

Navigate to remix.ethereum.org and you should select the environment as “Solidity”.
