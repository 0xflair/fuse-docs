## ðŸŒ‰ Transferring tokens from Ethereum to Fuse network

In this step-by-step bridging tutorial, we will use a [MetaMask wallet](https://metamask.io/download/) to bridge FUSE tokens from Fuse to the Ethereum network via the native [app.voltage.finance](https://app.voltage.finance/#/bridge) bridge.

<Admonition type="info" title="Bridging funds between Fuse and Ethereum networks is a 2-step process:">
  1. Token transfer - transferring tokens between Fuse\<>Ethereum.
  2. Token claim - claiming your tokens after transferring to Fuse or Ethereum network.

Step 1: Navigate to [app.voltage.finance/#/bridge:](https://app.voltage.finance/#/bridge)

Step 2: Press Connect wallet (1) on the right-hand, top corner of the page to connect your wallet to the [Voltage Finance](https://app.voltage.finance/) DApp. 

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">
  Once you connect, you should be able to see your wallet address and the network you are currently connected to - in this case, make sure you are connected to Ethereum network.

Step 3: Choose FUSE token (1) from the dropdown token menu and enter the amount of FUSE (2) you want to transfer from Ethereum to Fuse network and click the transfer (3) button.

<Admonition type="note" title="Note">
  Currently, you don't need to claim FUSE tokens when bridging from Ethereum so you can skip the rest of 'Step 4 claiming process' and just switch to Fuse network on your MM wallet.
