# Transferring tokens from Ethereum to Fuse network

In this step-by-step bridging tutorial, we will use a [MetaMask wallet](https://metamask.io/download/) to bridge FUSE tokens from **Ethereum network to Fuse** via the native [app.voltage.finance](https://app.voltage.finance/#/bridge) bridge.

1. **Token transfer** - transferring tokens between Fuse and Ethereum.
2. **Token claim** - claiming your tokens after transferring to Fuse or Ethereum network.

**Step 1:** Navigate to [app.voltage.finance/#/bridge:](https://app.voltage.finance/#/bridge)

**Step 2:** Press **Connect wallet** on the right-hand top corner of the page to connect your wallet to the [Voltage Finance](https://app.voltage.finance/) DApp.

Once you connect, you should be able to see your wallet address and the network you are currently connected to - in this case, make sure you are connected to \*\*\*Ethereum network\*\*\*.

**Step 3: Choose a token** from the dropdown token menu and **enter the amount** you want to transfer from Ethereum to Fuse network and **click the Bridge** button. Approve transaction on the MetaMask.

**Step 4:** Now **switch to Fuse network** on your MetaMask wallet, and you will see the tokens on your wallet.

**Step 5: Congratulations!** ðŸŽ‰ Your tokens were successfully bridged from EthereumFuse to Ethereum network!

In case you have closed the claiming tab, didn't receive the UI message to claim your tokens, or didn't have enough ETH to pay for gas - \*\*you can use the following debugging tool links\*\* to \*\*manually claim\*\* the tokens on the Fuse and Ethereum bridge:

* [amb.fuse.io](https://amb.fuse.io) - track the status of your bridge transactions
* [alm.fuse.io](https://alm.fuse.io) - manual claiming for ERC20 supported tokens (**except FUSE**)
* [fusealm.fuse.io](https://fusealm.fuse.io/) - manual claiming only for \*\*FUSE tokens \*\*
