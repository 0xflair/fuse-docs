This is a step-by-step guide explaining how to move BEP20-supported tokens between Fuse and BNB chain networks.

## üåâ Transferring tokens from Fuse network to BSC

In this step-by-step bridging tutorial, we will use a [MetaMask wallet](https://metamask.io/download/) to bridge FUSE tokens from Fuse to the BSC network via the native [app.voltage.finance](https://app.voltage.finance/#/bridge) bridge.

  Make sure you are connected to the Fuse Network RPC. To learn how to add the Fuse Network RPC you can follow the tutorial [here](https://docs.fuse.io/docs/tutorials/network-tutorials/tutorialsOverview).

Step 2: Press Connect wallet on the right-hand, top corner of the page to connect your wallet to the [Voltage Finance](https://app.voltage.finance/) DApp and click on To Binance to bridge to BSC network. 

Step 3: Choose FUSE token from the dropdown token menu and enter the amount of FUSE you want to transfer from BSC to Fuse network and click the Bridge button. 

Please note that the minimum amount eligible for bridging is $100 in FUSE. The same rule applies to other tokens on the bridge.

Once this is done, you can click on ‚ÄúTransfer‚Äù and approve the transaction. Once this transaction is confirmed on-chain, the FUSE balance will be moved to the bridge smart contract.

Finally, you will need to claim your FUSE from the bridge contract on BSC. Note that you will need to have enough BNB on your destination address on BSC to be able to claim the bridged tokens successfully.

Press on "Claim," confirm the transaction in MetaMask, and you will receive FUSE to your BSC address. The transaction can be tracked on [https://bscscan.com.](https://explorer.fuse.io/) 

IMPORTANT: Although the Fuse team is doing its best to ensure that all the bridge transfers go through smoothly, sometimes, transactions get stuck. If this happens, please use the interface at [https://bscalm.fuse.io/](https://bscalm.fuse.io/) to troubleshoot the issue or contact the team for support in our official [Telegram group](htps://t.me/fuse.io).
