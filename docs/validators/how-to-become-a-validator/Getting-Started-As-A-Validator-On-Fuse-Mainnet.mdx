# Updating Your Information

Running a Node successfully, let's look at how to update the information to be displayed on the [Staking App.](https://staking.fuse.io/ "Staking App")

To update the information, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Fork the Repository:

Start by forking the [repository](https://github.com/fuseio/fuse-staking-v2 "repository") to your own GitHub account. This will create a copy of the repository under your account that you can work with.

### Step 2: Update the \`.env\` file:

```
set "sudo" on `PERMISSION_PREFIX` if running docker/docker-compose requires root

(optional) set 'VAL_NAME' to display a custom name on health.fuse.io (cannot contain spaces)
```

### Step 3: Run the script as a validator:

```
./quickstart.sh
```

\:::tip

After running the script successfully, you will see your address in the [health](https://health.fuse.io/) site.
\:::

### Step 5: Stake and/or delegate!

#### Stake

To stake FUSE tokens, all you should do is send your FUSE tokens to the Fuse Consensus contract address over the Fuse network from the validator address.

\:::tip

The Fuse Consensus contract address: `0x3014ca10b91cb3D0AD85fEf7A3Cb95BCAc9c0f79`
\:::

The easiest way is to import your private key or key-store file to your favorite wallet (for example, Metamask), switch the network to Fuse, and send the FUSE tokens (native tokens) to the Consensus contract address.

\:::info
You can find your key-store (containing your private key) and the password for the created account in:

`$HOME/fusenet/config/keys/FuseNetwork/UTC--xxxx`

`$HOME/fusenet/config/pass.pwd`
\:::

#### Delegate

To delegate, send the FUSE tokens from any address to the Consensus contract address with the data: `0x5c19a95c000000000000000000000000<address without 0x>`.

\:::tip

Example:

For the address: `0xb8ce4a040e8aa33bbe2de62e92851b7d7afd52de`\
Use: `0x5c19a95c000000000000000000000000b8ce4a040e8aa33bbe2de62e92851b7d7afd52de` as the data.

`5c19a95c` is for the `delegate(address)` function signature.

`b8ce4a040e8aa33bbe2de62e92851b7d7afd52de`in this example, is an address you're delegating to (without the `0x` prefix)
\:::

### Step 6: Wait for one cycle (approximately 48 hours).

Wait until the next cycle is started.

\:::tip

You can see that you are validating both in the [health](https://health.fuse.io/) and explorer sites.
